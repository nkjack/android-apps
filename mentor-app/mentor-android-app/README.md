Made in April, 2016.

Mentor is an app designed to solve the problem of choosing your academic first degree.
It is an android app, written in Java, and has a server side where you can look at https://github.com/nkjack/Mentor_server_side.


Mentor gives the user a few things:

  - A search engine wide range of first degrees (In Israel).
  - Social networking platform between universities students and users.
  - platform for tracking the degrees you'r intresting in.
  

Within the app you can navigate to number of areas:

  1. Search - Search Pane for relevant degree. Search Mechanism incorporates themes and educational institutions. 
     Using the Advanced Search Mechanism it will navigate you to the relevant degree easily.
  2. The degree - the degree page opens for each degre an independent entity. In the degree page you can get all 
     the information about the relevant degree, and the date that the users of the app have shared it. In addition, 
     you can respond, rate, track and most importantly affect other users opinions about the degree.
  3. Updates - This panel will get all the titles that you follow them all 
     the comments and ratings written by the application users.
