# Mentor_server_side

This is the php scripts using in the Mentor application, you can see https://github.com/nkjack/Mentor_Android_App.

The Mentor app is a social app that needs a DB of users, academic degrees, universities, faculties, tags of degrees, and more 
including actions of users that were needed to be saved and documented inside the database.

The scripts are mainly connecting to the sql DB and fetch data with different sql queries.
You can find queries such as, inserting user post, manipulating the database and fetch degrees for your taste (with search input),
inserting profile image, and more..

The scripts are really straight forward giving the fetched data to the Mentor app in JSON format.
