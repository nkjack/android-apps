# E_Wallet_Android_App

A simple android app that save your cash transactions or any other transactions you have done.
It's an app that allows a user to design a monthly budget according to categories or subjects (each subject has its own sub budget).

After the user has organized his budget and sub budgets, he can now update the amount of cash he has spent, and the app will save it on the local phone database.

Using this app will help people to see what they are spending their money on, and in the furure will give certain statistics about their
use of money (made from their local db).
